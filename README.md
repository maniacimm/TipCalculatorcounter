# TipCalculator-Project
CSCI 490 Mobile App

Created an app that takes an input for an amount, an input for number of people spliting the check, a series of radio buttons for 
pre-determined tip amounts with the last radio button allowing for custom tip ammount, a button to reset the values, and a button to 
calculate the tip and total amount. All values retained state when the phone is rotated between portrait and landscape modes or 
any other instances where the app cycled through the activity lifecycle. An error message is displayed to the user if they try 
to input a bill amount less than $1, total people less than 1, or a tip percentage less than 1%.
